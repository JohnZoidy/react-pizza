# react-boilerplate

This is my own basic React-App template. Includes:

- Linter (ESlint);
- Babel;
- WebPack;
- Sass;
- Makefile;
- Jest;

So for use you just need to use commands:

1. Clone this repo:

```javascript
    git clone https://github.com/JohnZoidy/react-boilerplate.git
```
2. Then move into react-boilerplate directory and install dependencies:

```javascript
    cd react-boilerplate
    make install
```

3. Run project at wevpack devSever (localhost:550 as default in config):

```javascript
    make start
```

See other commands in makefile.
You can use similar commands by standart scripts in package.json.
